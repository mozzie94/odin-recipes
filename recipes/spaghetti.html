     <p>Doesn't it look tasty? Here's how to prepare the perfect Spaghetti</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>2 teaspoons of olive oil</li>
       <li>1 pound guanciale (cured pork cheek), diced</li>
       <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
       <li>3 large eggs</li>

   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
       <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade spaghetti:</p>
       <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add guanciale (see Cook's Note). Cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.</li>
       <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.</li>
       <li>Whisk eggs, 1/2 of the Pecorino Romano cheese, and some black pepper in a bowl until smooth and creamy.</li>
       <li>Pour egg mixture over pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy and slightly cooled. Stir in guanciale.</li>
       <li>Top with remaining Pecorino Romano cheese and more black pepper.</li>
       <li>Let the lasagna rest before serving.</li>
   </ol>
