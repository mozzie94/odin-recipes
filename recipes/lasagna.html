      <p>Doesn't it look tasty? Here's how to prepare the perfect Lasagna</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:</p>
        <li>Make the meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles.</li>
        <li>Make the ricotta mixture.</li>
        <li>Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How to layer lasagna</h3>
    <ol>
        <p>The detailed layering instructions can be found in the recipe below, but this is the order you'll follow:</p>
        <li>Meat sauce</li>
        <li>Noodles</li>
        <li>Ricotta mixture</li>
        <li>Mozzarella slices</li>
        <li>Meat sauce</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers, then top with the remaining Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How long to cook lasagna</h3>
     <p>The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.</p>

   <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>Doesn't it look tasty? Here's how to prepare the perfect Spaghetti</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>2 teaspoons of olive oil</li>
       <li>1 pound guanciale (cured pork cheek), diced</li>
       <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
       <li>3 large eggs</li>
       <li>10 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese, divided</li>
       <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
       <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade spaghetti:</p>
       <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add guanciale (see Cook's Note). Cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.</li>
       <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.</li>
       <li>Whisk eggs, 1/2 of the Pecorino Romano cheese, and some black pepper in a bowl until smooth and creamy.</li>
       <li>Pour egg mixture over pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy and slightly cooled. Stir in guanciale.</li>
       <li>Top with remaining Pecorino Romano cheese and more black pepper.</li>
       <li>Let the lasagna rest before serving.</li>
